# Employee Hierarchy Manager

A cloud hosted application is needed to manage its organisation's employee hierarchy. The application should allow a user to:

- create, read, update, and delete employee data
- control the employees reporting structure by setting an employee's reporting line manager.
- employees may not be their own manager, but may be in a position where they have not manager (i.e. CEO).
